# `wiki-presence` : Assessing and improving the representation of EPFL research and related topics on Wikipedia

This project aims to improve the representation of EPFL on Wikipedia. It comes in two parts :
- Assessing the current presence of EPFL's research and related topics on Wikipedia through data mining of the platform's articles and edit history.
- Building a set of guidelines and tools to help increase this presence in a way that is both user-friendly and independent of the field.

This project is under intensive development and will be better detailed as the year unrolls. It is supervised by Olivier Dubey and Martin Boyer of Mediacom.
